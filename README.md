# Game of Three (Takeaway.com coding challenge)

### Description: 
This repository contains the code for the 'Game of Three' coding challenge. 
Game of Three is a turn-based 2 player game in which the goal is to reach the number 1.

### Game mechanics:
Player 1 starts by providing a number and his opponent must add 1, subtract 1 or leave the number
unchanged so that the number is now divisible by three. The result from this division is then forwarded
back to player 1 and the loop continues until the result of the division is 1. The player who achieves this 
wins the game.
